# Pivoting.
Once we have obtained access to a target machine, it's time to reconoissaance, in this proccess we can find out that the hacked machine is part of another net out of our range.
Pivoting is a technique in which an attacker moves from one compromised system to the next, making it possible to attack machines that are initially hidden.
Chisel and Socat are versatile networking tools frequently used in cybersecurity for tasks like pivoting and tunneling. Chisel, a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, allows for quick and efficient port forwarding over HTTP, making it ideal for scenarios requiring secure and rapid connections. Socat, known as the "Swiss Army knife" of networking, supports a variety of protocols and connections, facilitating complex networking setups and relay scenarios. Both tools are essential in pivoting, where they help attackers or security professionals move laterally within a network to access isolated or restricted systems.

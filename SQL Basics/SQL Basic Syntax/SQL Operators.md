# SQL Operators.
Sometimes, expressions with a single condition are not enough to satisfy the user's requirement. For that, *SQL supports Logical Operators to use **multiple conditions at once**. 
The most common logical operators are **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**.<br />
We will use the next DB.<br /><br />

## AND Operator.
TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition:<br />

## OR Operator.
TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE:<br />

## NOT Operator.
Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE:<br />

### SYMBOLS Operators.
We can perform the same type of querys we did before using symbols instead of words:
| Operator   | Symbol   |
| ---------- | -------- |
| AND        |    &&    |
| OR         |     ||   |
| NOT        |     !    |


-------------------------------------

## UNION Operator.
The UNION operator is used to __combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements__.
- The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use [UNION ALL](#union-all-operator).
- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns ([Creating junk to match the columns](#creating-junk-to-match-the-columns)).
- The columns must also have similar data types.
- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order.
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers;
```
> NOTE: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects only distinct values. Use [UNION ALL](#union-all-operator) to also select duplicate values!
> 
### Selecting only one column for each table:
```sql
SELECT <column> FROM <table1> UNION SELECT <column> FROM <table2>;
```

</p>

### Creating junk to match the columns:
Maybe we want to display `SELECT * FROM TABLE;` using UNION, but we cannot do it because the tables don't have the same number of columns. In that case, we can create 'junk' to match the column numbers.
In this case the table "departments" only has 2 columns, `dept_no` and `dept_name`, whille "employees" has 6 columns. If we don't select the same number of columns we will encounter an error as we can see in the next 2 pictures:

</p>


```sql
SELECT * FROM employees UNION SELECT <column1>, <column2>, junk, junk, junk, junk FROM departments
```

</p>


> As we see, the TABLE employees has 6 columns, that's why only adding the exact number of "junk" (3, 4, 5, 6) we can match the columns of both tables and obtain the desired output.

### UNION ALL Operator.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```
